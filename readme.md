## 🚀 Getting Started (Quickstart)

Want to test the NanoLILY Core and LILY Bloom Engine on your own images? The fastest way is to use our interactive demo.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/Sanjeet2835/NanoLILY.git](https://github.com/Sanjeet2835/NanoLILY.git)
   cd NanoLILY
   ```
2. **Install the lightweight inference dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-inference.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Demo:** Open demo.ipynb, set your image path in the User Control Panel, and run the cells to instantly visualize the 3-way comparison (Input vs. Core vs. Bloom Engine).
  
## 🌸 System Architecture: Two Pillars
This repository tackles the problem of low-light image enhancement through two distinct engineering focuses: the mathematical core that learns the illumination mapping, and the deployment system that scales it.

### Pillar I: The Core Model (NanoLILY)
NanoLILY achieves competitive structural recovery on low-light datasets not by scaling up massive transformer blocks, but by combining a microscopic spatial CNN with a globally learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) mask.
* **Extreme Efficiency:** Operates at just **129K trainable parameters**, bypassing the massive memory costs of traditional self-attention mechanisms and making it highly suitable for edge devices.
* **Dual-Branch Architecture:** Utilizes a shallow spatial CNN branch to capture local pixel textures, running in parallel with an FFT-based frequency branch (`torch.fft.rfft2`) to capture global illumination context.
* **Perceptual Optimization:** Trained using a composite loss function blending VGG-19 Perceptual Loss, Structural Similarity (SSIM), and L1 Pixel loss to ensure outputs are structurally sound.

### Pillar II: The Inference Engine (LILY Bloom)
Because global FFT masks are mathematically locked to their training resolution (224x224), passing arbitrary 1080p/4K images directly into NanoLILY causes tensor shape mismatches. **LILY Bloom** is the inference pipeline built to solve this.
* **Resolution Independence:** LILY Bloom uses a sliding-window algorithm to slice arbitrary high-resolution images into overlapping patches, processing each through the NanoLILY core natively.
* **Seamless Blending:** To prevent the visible "checkerboard" seams caused by global frequency shifts between adjacent patches, LILY Bloom applies a mathematical **2D Hanning Window** to each output tensor. This forces the edges of every patch to smoothly fade to 0% opacity, allowing them to blend perfectly into a massive, uninterrupted high-resolution output.

## 🧠 Training Strategy: Two-Stage Pipeline

To maximize the model's ability to generalize across different low-light conditions, the training was executed in a two-phase pipeline:

1. **Phase 1: Baseline Pre-Training (LoL v1 Dataset)**
* **Notebook:** [NanoLILY.ipynb](https://github.com/Sanjeet2835/NanoLILY/blob/main/notebook/NanoLILY%20baseline.ipynb)
* The model was trained from scratch for 200 epochs on the standard LoL v1 dataset to learn the fundamental mapping between low-light degradation and target illumination.
* **Dynamic Loss Strategy:** SSIM weight was intentionally kept low (`0.01`) for the first 50 epochs to focus strictly on pixel-level illumination recovery (PSNR/L1). At epoch 51, the weight was scaled up 20x to `0.20` to refine structural edges and focus on perceptual quality once the baseline brightness was achieved.


2. **Phase 2: Fine-Tuning & Adaptation (LoL v2 Dataset)**
* **Notebook:** [Fine tuning NanoLILY.ipynb](https://github.com/Sanjeet2835/NanoLILY/blob/main/notebook/Fine%20tuning%20NanoLILY.ipynb)
* The pre-trained baseline was fine-tuned on the LoL v2 dataset (Real_captured) to adapt to its specific noise profiles and distribution shifts.
* **Refined Optimization:** The SSIM weight was strictly maintained at `0.2` from epoch 0. The learning rate was managed via a `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler, and training was monitored with an Early Stopping callback (patience=10, min_delta=0.00001) targeting maximum `val_ssim`.

## 🔮 Known Limitations & Future Scope

* **Mitigating OOD Sensor Noise:** Aggressively amplifying out-of-distribution (OOD) dark images amplifies baseline sensor noise. Future iterations will incorporate a **Total Variation (TV) Loss** penalty alongside SSIM/L1 to naturally smooth flat spatial regions.
* **Non-Uniform Illumination (HDR/Point Lights):** As documented in our [Failure Analysis](results/failure_analysis.md), the system currently struggles with intense, localized light sources (like streetlamps) due to a lack of HDR awareness. Future architectural updates will focus on disentangled illumination learning and global photometric normalization to prevent localized saturation.
